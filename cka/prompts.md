I want a step-by-step Kustomize exercise that builds from zero to a production-ready setup.

Rules:
- Give ONLY the questions / problem statements first. No solutions yet.
- Each step must be complete and deployable on its own.
- Each step should add new capability, but never rely on a future step.
- Use Kustomize only (no Helm, no templating).
- eventually it should cover all the trnasformter commonly used ( at least 10 to 15 )



Keep the steps progressive and realistic, from a simple starting point to a production-ready configuration.
it should mimic some applciation you can yuse standard images to mimic some thigns to test or pdocution, 

give full solution with yaml
