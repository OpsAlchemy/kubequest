# CKA

Always focus on practical tips only.

1. Always use the command line - it is much faster than editing YAML manually.
   Example: create or modify resources directly using CLI flags instead of opening an editor.

2. Always take a backup before making any changes.
   Example: save the current state of a resource before modifying it.

3. Use `kubectl explain` to verify syntax and object structure.
   Example: check available fields before writing or updating a manifest.
