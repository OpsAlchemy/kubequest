Here are solid, actually free places to practice real CKA-style scenarios:

* Killercoda CKA scenarios and Kubernetes playgrounds, all browser based and free to run. ([killercoda.com][1])
* GitHub repos with exam-like tasks:

  * alijahnas/CKA-practice-exercises (24 problem format). ([GitHub][2])
  * chadmcrowell/CKA-Exercises (pairs with Killercoda for free labs). ([GitHub][3])
  * devopshubproject/cka-lab (25 realistic questions). ([GitHub][4])
  * jayendrapatil/kubernetes-exercises (topic-mapped exercises). ([GitHub][5])
* Sailor.sh free CKA simulator with interactive labs. ([Sailor.sh][6])
* KodeKloud free Kubernetes labs, good for fundamentals if you need quick refreshers. ([KodeKloud][7])
* Official docs “Tasks” and “Administer a Cluster” sections, great for turning into your own scenarios. ([Kubernetes][8])

Quick tip: open a Killercoda Kubernetes playground, then follow a GitHub repo’s tasks in that live cluster. That gives you timed, terminal-only practice very close to exam conditions.
