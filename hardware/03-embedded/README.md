# Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers

Short: Building low-level systems and firmware that interact with sensors and hardware.

Topics:
- MCUs: ARM Cortex‑M, AVR, ESP32; bare‑metal vs Linux (Raspberry Pi)
- Peripherals: GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, ADC/DAC, PWM
- RTOS basics: FreeRTOS, tasks, low‑power modes

Starter projects:
- LED + sensor (I2C) logger to SD card or serial output
- Small RTOS task scheduler demo

Resources:
- PlatformIO, STM32/ESP32 docs, FreeRTOS tutorials
