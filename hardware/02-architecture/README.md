# Computer Architecture & CPUs

Short: CPU ISAs and microarchitecture concepts to understand how processors execute code.

Topics:
- ISA: RISC‑V, ARM, x86 overview
- Microarchitecture: pipelining, caches, branch prediction, memory hierarchy
- Performance counters & profiling basics

Starter projects:
- Study a simple RISC‑V ISA and run examples in QEMU
- Analyze cache behavior with microbenchmarks

Resources:
- Computer Organization and Design (book)
- RISC‑V docs, Agner Fog optimization manuals
