# Hardware Learning Hub

This folder contains categorized learning tracks and starter materials for hardware engineering.

Categories:
- `01-fundamentals` — Electronics, digital logic, measurements
- `02-architecture` — ISAs, microarchitecture, profiling
- `03-embedded` — MCUs, peripherals, RTOS, firmware
- `04-fpga-hdl` — Verilog/VHDL, FPGA toolchains

How to use:
- Start with `01-fundamentals` if new to hardware
- Each category has a `README.md` with topics, starter projects and resources
- Want a learning plan? Create an issue or request a tailored 3‑month plan in an issue

Contributions:
- Add project templates, sample code, diagrams, and lab exercises under each folder
- Keep README short and link to resources or subfolders for deeper content
