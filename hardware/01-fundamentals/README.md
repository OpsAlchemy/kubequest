# Fundamentals

Short: Core electrical and logical concepts that form the foundation for hardware engineering.

Topics:
- Digital logic: gates, combinational/sequential circuits, FSMs
- Electronics basics: Ohm's law, passive components, transistors
- Signal integrity & measurement: multimeter, oscilloscope, logic analyzers

Starter projects:
- Breadboard LED blink & simple debounced button
- Create a small logic circuit (gates) and simulate it

Resources:
- The Art of Electronics (book)
- Online: AllAboutCircuits, Khan Academy (electronics)
