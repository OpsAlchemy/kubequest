# Tools, Firmware & Projects

Short: Practical tools, debugging, PCB design and project templates to build and ship hardware.

Topics:
- Firmware: bootloaders, drivers, debugging with OpenOCD/GDB
- PCB design: KiCad workflows, BOM, Gerbers
- Testing & CI for firmware/hardware, hardware security basics

Projects:
- Design a simple PCB for your sensor project
- Build a CI pipeline to flash and test firmware on a board

Resources:
