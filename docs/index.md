# KillerCoda Notes – CKA

This repository contains **personal preparation notes** for the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** exam.

These notes are written to capture **practical behavior**, **working commands**, and **real failure modes** encountered while practicing Kubernetes — especially in timed, exam-style environments.

There is no attempt to be exhaustive or academic.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of these notes is to:
- Reduce thinking time during practice
- Record commands that actually work
- Document what breaks and how to fix it quickly
- Build muscle memory for exam scenarios

If something is written here, it is because it was **useful in practice**.

---

## How to Use

These notes are meant to be used while:
- Practicing KillerCoda scenarios
- Running local clusters
- Simulating exam conditions

They are **not** meant to be read linearly.  
They are meant to be **searched, skimmed, and referenced**.

---

## Scope

The content focuses on:
- Observable behavior (files, processes, pods)
- Operational workflows
- Debugging under time pressure
- Minimal explanations required to act correctly

Anything that does not help execution is intentionally omitted.

---

## Mindset

The CKA exam rewards:
- Precision
- Speed
- Familiarity with tooling

These notes prioritize:
- Commands over theory
- Fixes over descriptions
- Reality over documentation wording

---

## Ownership

These notes are a **living working document**.

They are expected to change as understanding improves and gaps are discovered.  
Accuracy matters more than polish.
